# Branding Guidelines

Weâ€™ve put together some guidelines for those anyone who wants to use our name and logo. In this context, "RomM", "The RomM Project", "the project", "we", "us", and "our" refer to the RomM project.

## The Logo

<div align="center">
  <img scr="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rommapp/wiki/refs/heads/main/romm.wiki/resources/romm/logo.svg" alt="Romm Logo" width="200"/>
</div>

The logo should always be used in its standard colors: `#ede5f8`, `#bea4e1`, `#371f69`, `#553e98`, `#e6c7a7`, and `#e1a38d`.

### Do these things

* Use our logo to link to any page or site owned or operated by the project.
* Use our logo in a blog post or news article about the project.
* Use our logo to inform others that your project integrates with RomM.
* Always use our logo in the colors provided.
* Always use our name in a way that makes it clear you are not affiliated with the project.

If you're working on a project that integrates with RomM and would like to use/remix the logo, please reach out to us first. We'd love to hear about what you're working on!

### Please don't do these things

* Use our name or logo in any way that would suggest you are us, are endorsed by us, or are part of the project.
* Use our name or logo in a way that implies partnership, sponsorship, or endorsement.
* Use our name or logo as the name or logo for your project, product, service, social media account, company, or website.
* Use our name or logo to promote, advertise or sell any private business, closed-source software, commercial product, or paid service.

[EmulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org/) is a web-based emulator for various system; that is, it allows you to run old games in your web browser. It's based on [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/), which is a toolchain for compiling C and C++ code to WebAssembly.

### Loading saves and states

Our integration with EmulatorJS automates the process of loading and saving save files and save states. Before starting the game, select a save and/or state file to load (if one is available). Anytime you save the game (or create a save state), the save and state files stored with RomM will be updated, so there's no need to manually download or upload them.

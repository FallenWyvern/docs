In the Administration panel are the tools used to manage users on the server. The first user created will always be given the admin Role. 

A user will be able to manage their own game saves, save states, their profile icon, and the "Personal" data tab on games.

## Adding Users

Adding a User is as simple as adding a username, password, email address, and selecting a role. Users can be added manually using the "Add" button or inviting a user by link. If you invite a user in this manner, all you need to set is a role and they will be prompted to fill in the rest.

### Roles Explained

**Admin** - The highest authority role. This grants full permission to do everything on the server.

**Editor** - This role has the ability to edit platforms and games (adding, removing, or scanning for new content) and make collections public.

**Viewer** - The lowest authority role. You can play games, and interact with Personal data tab.

## Removing Users

Removing a user is as simple as clicking the red garbage icon, and confirming the operation.

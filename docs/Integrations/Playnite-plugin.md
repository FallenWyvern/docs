[Playnite](https://playnite.link) is an open source video game library manager with one simple goal: To provide a unified interface for all of your games.

[This plugin](https://github.com/rommapp/playnite-plugin) allows you to import your RomM library into Playnite. It queries the RomM API to create Playnite library entires for each of your games. Installing a game in Playnite will download it from RomM and store it on your system, allowing you to launch it in your emulator of choice.

## Setup

You can find the installation guide <a href="https://github.com/rommapp/playnite-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#installation" target="_blank">here</a>.

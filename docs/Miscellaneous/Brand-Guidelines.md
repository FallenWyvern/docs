Weâ€™ve put together some guidelines for those anyone who wants to use our name and logo. In this context, "RomM", "The RomM Project", "the project", "we", "us", and "our" refer to the RomM project.

## The Logo

<div align="center">
  <img src="../../resources/romm/logo.svg" height="180px" width="180px" alt="RomM logo">
  <br />
  <br />

The logo should always be used in its standard colors:

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Color</th>
      <th>Hex Code</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../../resources/romm/371f69.png" height="16px" width="16px" alt="#371f69"></td>
      <td>#371f69</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../../resources/romm/553e98.png" height="16px" width="16px" alt="#553e98"></td>
      <td>#553e98</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../../resources/romm/ede5f8.png" height="16px" width="16px" alt="#ede5f8"></td>
      <td>#ede5f8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../../resources/romm/bea4e1.png" height="16px" width="16px" alt="#bea4e1"></td>
      <td>#bea4e1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../../resources/romm/e6c7a7.png" height="16px" width="16px" alt="#e6c7a7"></td>
      <td>#e6c7a7</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../../resources/romm/e1a38d.png" height="16px" width="16px" alt="#e1a38d"></td>
      <td>#e1a38d</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
